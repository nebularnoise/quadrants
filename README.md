# Quadrants

Quadrants is a skiff-friendly SMD version of the [Prok Drum Modules](https://www.thonk.co.uk/product-category/manufacturer/prok-modular/).

I love the Prok modules, but the 3-boards sandwich made them too deep to fit in my drum skiff. With this version, the depth is no longer about 40mm, but rather 30mm.
